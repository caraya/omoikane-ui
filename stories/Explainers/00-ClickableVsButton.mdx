# Clickable vs Button

In the Omoikane Design System, both `Clickable` and `Button` allow users to trigger actions, but they serve different architectural and semantic purposes. Understanding when to use which is key to building consistent UI.

## At a Glance

**Button**: A standard, styled UI element for primary actions. | You need a standard "call to action" (e.g., Submit, Cancel, Save) that matches the system's look and feel.

**Clickable**: A primitive wrapper that makes *anything* interactive. | You need to make a custom element (like a card, a row, or an icon) interactive, or you need full control over the `hover/press` visual states.

## Button

The `Button` component is a high-level component that comes pre-packaged with specific styles (Primary, Secondary, Tertiary, Destructive). It enforces the design system's visual language.

**Characteristics:**
- Pre-defined padding, colors, and typography.
- Standard variants (Solid, Outline, Ghost).
- Limited customization (by design) to ensure consistency.

**Example:**
```tsx
<Button intent="primary">Save Changes</Button>
```

---

## Clickable
The `Clickable` component is a low-level primitive. It handles the *behavior* of being interactive (roles, keyboard support, focus management, hover states) without enforcing a specific *look*.

**Characteristics:**
- No visual styles by default (it's "headless" regarding UI).
- Renders as either `<button>` or `<a>` depending on `href`.
- Supports the **Render Prop** pattern to allow children to react to state changes (`hovered`, `focused`, `pressed`).
- Ideal for building new interactive components.

**Example:**
```tsx
<Clickable onClick={() => alert('Clicked!')}>
  {({ hovered, pressed }) => (
    <div className={hovered ? "bg-gray-100" : "bg-white"}>
      Custom Interactive Card
    </div>
  )}
</Clickable>
```

## Decision Tree

1. **Do you need a standard "Submit" or "Cancel" button?**
   👉 Use `Button`.

2. **Are you building a custom UI element (like a clickable user avatar or a complex list item)?**
   👉 Use `Clickable`.

3. **Do you need a link that looks like a button?**
   👉 Use `Button` with `link={true}` or `href`.

4. **Do you need a custom area of the screen to be valid for keyboard navigation and screen readers?**
   👉 Use `Clickable`.
