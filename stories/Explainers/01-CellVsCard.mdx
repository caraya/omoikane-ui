# Cell vs Card

Deciding between using a **Cell** or a **Card** depends largely on the density of the information and the relationship of the item to its siblings.

## At a Glance

**Primary Use Cases**
*   **Cell:** Navigation lists, settings menus, contacts, data rows.
*   **Card:** Dashboards, feed items, object summaries, media display.

**Layout**
*   **Cell:** Horizontal, single-line or double-line. Highly constrained.
*   **Card:** Stacked, flexible height. Box model layout.

**Density**
*   **Cell:** High density. Designed to be stacked tightly.
*   **Card:** Medium to Low density. Requires padding and margins.

**Interactivity**
*   **Cell:** Usually the entire area is clickable (navigation).
*   **Card:** Can have multiple interactive elements (buttons, links) inside.

**Structure**
*   **Cell:** Leading (Icon) + Content (Title/Sub) + Trailing (Action/Info).
*   **Card:** Header, Body, Media, Footer, Actions.

## Detailed Guidelines

### When to use a Cell

Use the `Cell` component when you are presenting a homogeneous list of items where the user scans for a specific entry. Cells are optimized for vertical scanning efficiency.

*   **Navigation**: Drill-down menus or navigation drawers.
*   **Settings**: Toggles, value selection, or sub-pages.
*   **Data Lists**: Lists of users, files, or logs where the metadata is minimal.

**Characteristics:**
*   Fixed structural regions (Left, Center, Right).
*   Typically full-width or filling a narrow column.
*   Separators are common between cells.

### When to use a Card

Use the `Card` component when the items are heterogeneous or contain rich content that requires more structure than a simple title/subtitle pair. Cards standout as individual objects.

*   **Dashboards**: KPIs, charts, or summary widgets.
*   **Feeds**: Posts, news items, or activity logs with preview images.
*   **Object Details**: A profile summary, a product card, or a document preview.

**Characteristics:**
*   Visually separated by borders or shadows (elevation).
*   Can contain complex internal layouts (columns, grids).
*   Often arranged in grids (masonry or flexible rows).

## Key Differences

1.  **Complexity**: If you need to put a chart, a large image, or multiple distinct buttons inside the item, use a **Card**. If it's just an icon plus text, use a **Cell**.
2.  **Grouping**: **Cells** almost always appear in groups (lists/sections). **Cards** can appear significantly alone.
3.  **Action Area**: **Cells** favor a single primary action (tap/click the row). **Cards** often contain multiple discrete actions (Like, Share, Read More).
