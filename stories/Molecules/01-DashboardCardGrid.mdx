# DashboardCardGrid

`DashboardCardGrid` is a medium-level molecule composed from smaller primitives: `CustomGrid`, `Card`, `Toolbar`, and `Popover`.

It demonstrates composition patterns for dashboards or admin consoles where tiles have actions, can be placed precisely using grid coordinates, and may expose secondary UI (popovers) for details or actions.

## Features

- Precise placement via `col`, `row`, `colSpan`, `rowSpan` on card descriptors.
- Responsive column behavior: collapses to 1 column on narrow viewports, 2 columns on medium screens, and honors the `columns` prop on larger viewports.
- Accessible interactions:
  - A skip link is provided to jump to the dashboard area.
  - Action buttons announce they open a dialog via `aria-haspopup="dialog"` and are linked with `aria-controls`.
  - The molecule uses the `Popover` primitive which focuses the popover panel when opened and handles `Escape` to close.

## Composition Pattern

Use `DashboardCardGrid` when you want a plug-and-play dashboard surface where cards may be rearranged by data (server-driven placement) or where certain cards need explicit placement without creating empty DOM rows.

Basic usage is covered in the story `Molecules/DashboardCardGrid/Playground` which provides interactive knobs for columns, gap, and cards.
